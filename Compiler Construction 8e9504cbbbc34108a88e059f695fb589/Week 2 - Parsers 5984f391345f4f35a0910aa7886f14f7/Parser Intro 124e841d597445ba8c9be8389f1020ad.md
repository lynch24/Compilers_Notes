# Parser Intro

digits = [0-9]+

sum = expr + expr

expr = “(” sum “)” | digit

trying to recognise an expression with balanced parentheses

(12 + (52 + 7))

Regex cannot count

An automaton with N states cannot handle an expression with more than N sets of balanced parentheses

## Context Free Grammars

Context free syntax is specified with a context free grammar

A CFG G is represented with a 4 tuple(Vt, Vn, S, P)

Vt: set of terminals symbols in the grammar/set of tokens returned by scanner

Vn: set of nonterminals

S: distinguished nonterminal denoting the entire set of strings in L(G). Sometimes called the goal symbol

P: Finite set of productions specifying how terminals and nonterminals can be combined to form strings in each language, each production must have a single nonterminal on its left hand side

V = Vt union Vn is called the vocabulary of G

Grammars are often written in BNF form

1. <goal> ::= <expr>
2. <expr> ::= <expr><op><expr>
    
                 | num
    
           | id
    

A sequence of production applications is a derivation or a parse. Parsing is the process of discovering a derivation for a statement

## Derivations

Leftmost derivation: The leftmost terminal is replaced at each step

Rightmost derivation: The rightmost terminal is replaced at each step

### Precedence

A problem with grammar is that the evaluation order is implied by the grammar

One way to add precedence to the grammar is to add additional structure to the grammar

By adding additional structure, we imply an evaluation order and we get a correct tree

Terms must be derived from expr expressions

Factors must be derived from terms

### Ambiguity

If a sentence admits two or more derivations

<stmt> ::= if <expr> then <stmt>

> if <expr> then <stmt> else <stmt>
> 

> other stmts
> 

if E1 then E2 then S1 else S2 has two derivations with this grammar

Rearranging the grammar eliminates the ambiguity. 

<stmt> ::= <matched>

> <unmatched>
> 

<matched> ::= if <expr> then <matched> else <matched>

> other stmts
> 

<unmatched> ::= if <expr> then <stmt>

> if <expr> then <matched> else <unmatched>
>

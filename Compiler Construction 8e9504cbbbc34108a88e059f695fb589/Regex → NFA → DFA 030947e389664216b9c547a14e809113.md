# Regex → NFA → DFA

We need an NFA to recognise a regular expression

We cannot execute an NFA

It is more accurate to view the NFA as executing all nondeterministic paths concurrently and if any path terminates successfully then the NFA terminates successfully

The subset construction algorithm converts an NFA to a DFA using two concepts

1. epsilon-closure(S): all the states that can be reached from state S without consuming any symbols i.e using epsilon edges only
2. DFAedge(d, c): all the states that can be reached from the states in d by consuming only edges labelled with c and epsilon

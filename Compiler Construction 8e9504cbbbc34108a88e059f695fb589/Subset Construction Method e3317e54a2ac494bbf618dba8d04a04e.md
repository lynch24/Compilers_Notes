# Subset Construction Method

1. Construct augmented regex for the given expression by appending a marker # to regex r, an accepting state
2. Construct syntax tree for r#
3. Evaluate four functions; nullable, firstpos, lastpos and followpos
    1. nullable(n) is true for a syntax tree node n if and only if the regex represented by n has epsilon in its language
    2. firstpos(n) gives the set of positions that can match the first symbol of a string generated by the subexpression rooted at n
    3. lastpos(n) gives the set of positions that can match the last symbol of a string generated by the subexpression rooted at n

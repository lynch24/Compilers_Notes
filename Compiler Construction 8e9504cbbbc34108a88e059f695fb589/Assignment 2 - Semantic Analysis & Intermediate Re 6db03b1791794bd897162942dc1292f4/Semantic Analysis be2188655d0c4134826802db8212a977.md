# Semantic Analysis

Check everything that can be checked statically (without running the program)

- In reasonable amount of time
- No real symbolic execution

Perform checks after parsing

Write custom Autumn parsing combinator

Defer to semantic analysis

### Main Concerns

Type checking

- int x = “string”
- type inference var x = “string” + 42

Name Binding

- int x = y + 3 // what is y?
- interdependency with typing: var x = a . b. c;

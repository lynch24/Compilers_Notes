# Semantic Analysis

Semantic actions of a parser perform useful operations

- Build an AST
- Type checking
- Eval in the case of an interpreter
- Begin the translation process in the case of a compiler

In ANTLR the syntax trees are automatically generated

### ASTs

A parse tree is a data struct that is used to separate parsing(lexical and syntactic) from semantics (type checking and translation to machine code)

It is possible to write the compiler so that everything is done by the semantic actions of the parsing phase

However this constrains the compiler to analyse input exactly in the order it was parsed and is very difficult to maintain

A concrete parse tree has

- Exactly one terminal node (leaf node) for each token in the input
- One internal node for each production rule reduced during the parse

An AST is a clean interface between parsing and semantic analysis

The AST captures the phrase structure of the input

### Visitors

A visitor implements an interpretation. It is an object that contains a method for each kind i.e each class of the syntax tree node

- Each tree class has an accept method that is called by the visitor
- The accept method acts as a hook for all interpretations
- Accept method’s only task is to call the visitor, parameterised by the accept method’s own type. This ensures that the correct visitor method is invoked

### Symbol Tables

A symbol table or environment, maps identifiers to their types and locations

As types, variables and locations are declared they are added to the symbol table

When an id is used, it is looked up in the symbol table

Environments are a set of bindings where a → x denotes a is bound to x

For example, sigma(0) = { g → string, a → int } denotes an environment where g is a string variable and a is an integer variable

How do we implement symbol tables so that:

We find the correct binding

We can efficiently discard environments

A hash table with external chaining and an undo stack can do the required tasks efficiently

### Symbol Table Hash Table Implementation

- A hash function converts the symbol into an index in a table
    - Should be capable of being evaluated quickly
    - Resulting indices should be randomly distributed across table so it is unlikely two different symbols will result in the same hash value(or index)
- Each entry in the table is a linked list of bindings
    - When a binding is added, it is inserted at the front of the linked list associated with the symbol’s hash value
    - When looking up a symbol in the hash table the linked list associated with the symbol’s hash value is searched from the front. This way the search will always find the most recent binding that involves that symbol
    - To improve lookup time and make use of locality, you move a symbol that you have successfully searched for to the front of the list
    
    Undo Stack
    
    - Whenever a binding is added to the symbol table, the binding is also pushed onto the undo stack
    - When a new scope is created, a special marker is pushed onto the stack
    - When a scope is being destroyed, the entries on the stack are popped off and removed from the symbol table until the special marker is popped off the stack

# 2.1 Intro

Analysis is organised around the syntax of the language to be compiled

The syntax of a language describes the proper form of its programs while semantics define what the program means; that is, what each program does when it executes

For specifying syntax, we used context-free grammars or BNF

For this chapter, we are considering the syntax-driven translation of infix operations to postfix form

i.e 9 - 5 + 2 becomes 95 - 2 +

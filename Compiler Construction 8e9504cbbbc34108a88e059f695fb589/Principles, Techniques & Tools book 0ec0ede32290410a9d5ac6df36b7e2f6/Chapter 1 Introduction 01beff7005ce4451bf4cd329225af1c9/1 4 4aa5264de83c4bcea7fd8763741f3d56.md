## Science of Code Optimisation

Optimisation is a misnomer, there is no way that the code produced by optimisation is guaranteed to be as fast or faster than any other code that performs the same task; it is an attempt to optimise

Massively parallel computers require substantial optimisation or their performance suffers by orders of magnitude

Graphs, matrices and linear programs are necessary if the compiler is to produce well optimised code

Compiler optimisation must meet the following design objectives

- Optimisation must be correct, that is, preserve the meaning of the compiled program
- The optimisation must improve the performance of many programs
- The compilation must be kept reasonable
- The engineering effort required must be manageable

Most importantly, it must be correct

# Symbol Table

[Language Pattern Implementations - Symbol Table](Symbol%20Table%2076e16400cf7a4519b9b9f92531e86317/Language%20Pattern%20Implementations%20-%20Symbol%20Table%20d4479ce197b345f79349991b5866c64b.md)

- Linear list
- Hash table
- BST

Operations

- Insert()
- Used in analysis phase when tokens are identified and stored in the table
- Used to insert info into the symbol table like the unique name occurring in the source code
- The attribute for a symbol is associated with that symbol. The info contains the state, value, type and scope about the symbol
- Insert() takes the symbol and its value in the form of an argument

Lookup()

- Used to search for a name
- Used to determine the existence of a symbol in the table
- Declaration of a symbol before it is used
- Check whether name is used in the scope
- Initialisation of the symbol
- Checking whether the name is declared multiple times
- 

Maps ids to their types and locations

As types, variables and functions are declared, they are added to the symbol table

How does the + Operator for envs work when both environments contain different bindings?

We would like a later binding to take precedence

Hash table with external chaining and an undo stack

- Converts symbol into an index in a table/array
    - Indices should be randomly distributed across the table so it is unlikely two symbols will result in the same hash value
- Each entry in the table is a linked list of bindings

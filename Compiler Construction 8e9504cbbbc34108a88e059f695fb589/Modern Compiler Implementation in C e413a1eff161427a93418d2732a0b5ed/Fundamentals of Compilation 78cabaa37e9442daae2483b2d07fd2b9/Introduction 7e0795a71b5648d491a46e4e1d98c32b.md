Breaking the compiler into this many pieces allows for reuse of the components, to change the target machine for which the compiler produces machine language, it suffices to replace just the Frame Layout and Instruction Selection modules

Two of the most useful abstractions for modern compilers are context free grammars for parsing and regular expressions for lexical analysis

To make use of these, it is helpful to have special tools like yacc(which converts a grammar into a parsing program) and Lex(which converts a declarative specification into a lexical analysis program)

| Lex | Break the source file into individual words, or tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Parse | Analyse the phrase structure of the program |
| Semantic Actions | Build a piece of abstract syntax tree corresponding to each phrase |
| Frame Layout | Place variables, function-parameters, etc. into activation records(stack frames) in a machine-dependent way |
| Translate | Produce intermediate representation trees(IR trees), a notation that isnâ€™t tied to any particular source lang or machine arch |
| Canonicalise | Hoist side effects out of expressions, and clean up conditional branches, for the convenience of the next phases |
| Instruction Selection | Group the IR-tree nodes into clumps that correspond to the actions of the target machine instructions |
| Control Flow Analysis | Analyse the sequence of instructions into a control flow graph that shows all possible flows of control the program might follow when it executes |
| Dataflow Analysis | Gather information about the flow of info through variables of the program; for example, liveness analysis calculates the places where each program variable holds a still-needed value(is live) |
| Register Allocation | Choose a register to hold each of the variables and temporary values used by the program; variables not live at the same time can share the same register |
| Code Emission | Replace the temporary names in each machine instruction with machine registers |

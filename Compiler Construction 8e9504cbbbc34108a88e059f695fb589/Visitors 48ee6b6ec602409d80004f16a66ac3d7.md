# Visitors

Used to analyse and manipulate parse trees

When -visitor is invoked, a visit method, using java generics, will be generated for each node in the parse tree

For a node of type X, a visitX method is generated (the first letter is capitalised)

Each visit method is parameterised by a context object and we use this context object to query the current node and to access its child nodes

If the grammar is called Y, and the type of node is X, then the context object has the type YParser.XContext
